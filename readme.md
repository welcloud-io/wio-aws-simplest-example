### Ready to use Cloudformation templates
###### !! These templates may incur (small) costs. Delete them when you are done !!
###### !! They are built for AWS (Amazon Web Services) and for learning/test purpose !!
###### !! You should test them in a sandbox or dev account (NOT in a production Account) !!
---
##### For simplicity we assume :
##### - You are currently logged-in an AWS account with an IAM ADMIN user or role 
##### - Your AWS account is a SANDBOX or a DEV account
##### - You are working in AWS Ireland Region (eu-west-1)
##### - You still have your "Default VPC" Network into your AWS Account
