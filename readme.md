### Ready to use Cloudformation templates
###### !! These templates may incur (small) costs. Delete them when you are done !!
###### !! They are built for AWS and for learning purpose !!
###### !! You should create them in a sandbox or dev account (NOT a production Account) !!
---
##### For simplicity we assume :
##### - You are currently logged into an AWS account with an IAM admin user or role 
##### - Your AWS account is a SANDBOX or a DEV account
##### - You are working in AWS Ireland Region (eu-west-1)
##### - You still have your "Default VPC" Network into your AWS Account
